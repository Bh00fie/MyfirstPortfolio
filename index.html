      <div id="About-me-text">
        <p> <!--  My passions and something curios about me -->
          As a Technology fanatic, I spend most of my life getting deep into engineering and learning new skills, from manual milling machines to 3D printing, from basic of Python to Web Development. I am not seeking to be a master of everything, I simply believe an Engineer should have a basic knowledge of everything, every science as this could come handy when solving a problem. A part of of being overly passionate about Engineering, I fluently speak five languages, English, Italian, Spanish, Hindi and Punjabi. It is something that I naturally learned by living in different places to my Dad's job.
        </p>
        <p> <!--  My Career info -->
          Career wise, growing up in Italy, during my Secondary School, I had a three long internship where I was working as Mechatronic Technician for a small company and I had the opportunity to be a First-Aid Volunteer, moving to the UK in 2019, I spent every summer so far volunteering during the pandemic and gain more job experiences while doing my Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering degree at the University of Southampton, this include a summer placement at New Motion Lab as Mechanical Design Engineer and currently as New Product Introduction Manufacturing Engineer at Cummins Inc.
